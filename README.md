# Tutorial: Synpase Matrix docker-compose setup (pi compatible) w/ PostgresDB

This tutorial describes the setup of a matrix homeserver hidden behind a VPN (so you don't have to expose your local IP and have all the data locally stored)

## Requirements:
- Small VPS with public IP
- any domain
- raspberry pi (I'm using the 4 1GB version currently)

## VPS Setup (using Debian 10 in this tutorial):
Setup your VPS as usual - setup nginx, certbot, ufw, fail2ban, stuff like that.
```
sudo apt install nginx, certbot, ufw, fail2ban
```
### Firewall setup (on the VPS)
Port 8448 is the matrix federation port.
Port 51194 is used by wireguard - if you've used a different port in the tuturial you'll also have to use it here
```
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 8448/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51194/udp
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```
### Wireguard Setup (on the VPS)
And just follow this tutorial to setup the VPN/wireguard: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-10-set-up-wireguard-vpn-server/

Once you've setup the VPN connection between the VPS and your Pi, verify it by pinging the other host:
(If you've used the same ip's as in the tutorial)
To check the connection from the pi:
```user@pi$ ping 192.168.10.1```

To check the connection from the vps:
```user@vps$ ping 192.168.10.2```

### Reverse Proxy Setup (on the VPS)
Make sure you've setup your domains DNS A Entry to point to your VPSs public IP.
Obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate using the certbot - for this nginx has to be turned off and the firewall has to be setup properly.
```
certbot certonly
```
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
nano <yourdomain>.matrix.proxy.conf
```
#### <yourdomain>.matrix.proxy.conf
```
# HTTP redirect
server {
    listen      80;
    listen      [::]:80;
    server_name <yourdomain>;
    return      301 https://<yourdomain>$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen      443 ssl http2;
    listen      [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name <yourdomain>;

    listen 8448 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:8448 ssl http2 default_server;

    # SSL
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/privkey.pem;

    #access_log          /var/log/nginx/<yourdomain>.access.log anonymized;
    error_log           /var/log/nginx/<yourdomain>.error.log warn;

    # reverse proxy
    location ~ ^(/_matrix|/_synapse/client) {
        
        #IP of your client in the VPN
        proxy_pass http://192.168.10.2:8008;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;

        # Nginx by default only allows file uploads up to 1M in size
        # Increase client_max_body_size to match max_upload_size defined in homeserver.yaml
        client_max_body_size 350M;
    }
    gzip            on;
    gzip_vary       on;
    gzip_proxied    any;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_types      text/plain text/css text/xml application/json application/javascript application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml;
}
```

## Synapse/Matrix Setup
    
To setup the synapse server on your pi/homeserver, we are using docker/docker-compose, so make sure both are present on your host:
```
apt install docker docker-compose
```

Now you create the docker-compose.yaml in a directory where the data generated by the matrix server shall also be stored.
``` 
nano docker-compose.yaml
```
#### docker-compose.yaml
```
version: '3.3'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
     - ./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
     - ./init-db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    environment:
     - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CHANGEME
     - POSTGRES_USER=CHANGEME
     - POSTGRES_DB=CHANGEME
     - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C
    expose:
     - 5432
    networks:
     - matrix
  synapse:
    image: matrixdotorg/synapse
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8008:8008
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    networks:
     - matrix
networks:
 matrix:
```
    
Once you've created the docker-compose file and changed the postgres environment parameters to sonmething valid:
e.g.:
```
     - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=P4$$w0rd
     - POSTGRES_USER=synapse_dbuser
     - POSTGRES_DB=synapse_db
```
You can proceed by generating your homeserver.yaml (synapse config file) by entering the following command (in the same dir the docker-compose.yaml is located):
```
docker run -it --rm -v ./data:/data -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=<yourdomain> -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=no matrixdotorg/synapse:latest generate
```
Once you've run this command you can proceed to configure your homeserver.yaml file, that should be located at ./data/homeserver.yaml.
In this config file you can change all synapse settings, but for now we focus on the database settings:
Go to the database section: (search for "## Database ##" or "database:")
and enter the config you've used in the docker-compose.yaml:
```
database:
  name: psycopg2
  txn_limit: 10000
  args:
    user: synapse_dbuser
    password: P4$$w0rd
    database: synapse_db
    host: postgres
    port: 5432
    cp_min: 5
    cp_max: 10
```
    
Now you're nearly finished, you just have to either get the registration_secret (token that can be used for registration, even when registrations are closed) or allow any user to register an account at your server (enable_registration, if you have no verifcation setup you also have to enable_registration_without_verification - which is not recommended - you can switch this off at any time).
    
Once you are happy with your configuration, save the file and navigate back to the location of the docker-compose.yaml file.
Now all you have to do is start the containers, by calling:
```
docker-compose up
```
Note: We are not using the ```-d``` option for the first start-up, so we can trace errors or possible misconfiguration without having to search through the docker logs.
   
You can check wether the server is operational by navigating to https://<yourdomain>/__matrix/static/ . 
You should see a screen like this:

Once all is setup and running you can ```Ctrl-D``` out of the logs and restart the containers in the background using:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
